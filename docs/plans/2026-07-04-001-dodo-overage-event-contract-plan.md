# Dodo Overage Billable Usage Event Contract

## Goal Capsule

- **Objective:** Prepare the smallest production-ready #4560 increment by defining a disabled-by-default billable API usage event contract that can feed future Dodo overage ingestion without putting Dodo calls on the request hot path.
- **Authority:** Issue #4560 and overlapping issue #3117 define the target architecture; current `origin/main` source is the executable Phase 1 contract because the issue-referenced Phase 1 plan path is not present in this checkout.
- **Scope:** Add a typed builder and focused tests around eligible billable usage events. Do not configure Dodo meters, send events, set prices, create spend caps, or subscribe to webhooks.
- **Stop condition:** The code exposes a tested payload contract that separates commercial overage eligibility from the existing per-minute burst limiter and daily allowance enforcement.

## Product Contract

### Summary

Phase 1 meters per-account REST API usage and enforces per-minute burst plus a daily allowance policy. PR #4684 removes the earlier 10x runaway-ceiling multiplier in favor of a hard daily cap in enforce mode; shadow mode still serves over-allowance requests uncounted-against-a-ceiling. Phase 2 needs that metered allowance to become billable overage through Dodo, but the epic still has unresolved commercial decisions. This increment creates the event contract that future async ingestion can consume once pricing and Dodo catalog decisions are resolved.

Sequencing note: the overage event fires only for *served* over-allowance requests (the shadow-mode path). It is therefore incompatible with #4684's hard-cap enforce mode, which refuses over-allowance requests with a 429 and rolls back the meter increment — the builder excludes those refusals (401/403/429 and 5xx are never billable). Reconciling billable overage with hard-cap enforcement needs an explicit opt-in overage mechanism and is tracked at the product level (epics #4560 / #4635), not in this slice.

### Requirements

- R1. A billable event candidate MUST represent only commercial overage usage and MUST stay separate from the existing per-minute burst hard 429 and daily-allowance enforcement (the #4684 hard cap).
- R2. The event contract MUST include stable idempotency material so future Dodo ingestion can create deterministic `event_id` values.
- R3. The event contract MUST carry customer lookup inputs without requiring the gateway to know a Dodo customer id synchronously.
- R4. The event contract MUST reject unbillable outcomes, including 5xx handler failures, because #4560 flags billable 5xx treatment as a gating decision for live charging.
- R5. The increment MUST NOT send events to Dodo or introduce live overage charges before model, pricing, cycle, alerting, and spend-cap decisions are resolved.

### Scope Boundaries

- Deferred for later: Dodo meter creation, Dodo `POST /events/ingest`, customer-id resolution action, cron or `waitUntil` batching, 80%/100% credit balance emails, and customer spend caps.
- Outside this slice: changing `apiDailyAllowance` values, changing the daily-cap / enforce-mode behavior (owned by #4684), or changing per-IP/per-account enforcement behavior.

### Sources

- Issue #4560: usage-based overage billing epic.
- Issue #3117: older Dodo metered billing tracker.
- `server/_shared/api-key-rate-limit.ts`: Phase 1 per-account burst and daily meter.
- `server/gateway.ts`: gateway chokepoint where Phase 1 meter is invoked before handler execution.
- `convex/payments/billing.ts`: existing userId to Dodo customer id resolver pattern for billing actions.

## Planning Contract

### Key Technical Decisions

- KTD1. Keep the increment pure and disabled. A pure builder can be validated without credentials and cannot accidentally bill customers.
- KTD2. Use userId as the customer lookup input. The gateway already has Clerk user identity for user API keys, while Convex owns the Dodo customer mapping.
- KTD3. Exclude non-billable outcomes at the contract layer: 5xx handler failures, 401/403 (no authorized work), and the enforce-mode 429 refusal (whose meter INCR is rolled back). Even if the final product decision evolves, this prevents future ingestion from billing refused or failed requests by default.
- KTD4. Keep idempotency deterministic from user, UTC day, route, status, and observed count. Future batching can replay safely without duplicate event identity drift.

### High-Level Design

```mermaid

  A["Phase 1 daily meter result"] --> B["Billable usage event builder"]
  C["Gateway terminal response status"] --> B
  D["User API key identity"] --> B
  B --> E["Candidate event or null"]
  E --> F["Future async Dodo ingestion"]
```

The current PR stops at `Candidate event or null`. Future work can enqueue or batch this object after Dodo catalog decisions are complete.

## Implementation Units

### U1. Add billable API usage event builder

- **Goal:** Create a pure helper that turns Phase 1 meter context plus terminal response status into a future Dodo overage event candidate or `null`.
- **Requirements:** R1, R2, R3, R4, R5
- **Files:**
  - Create: `server/_shared/api-overage-billing.ts`
  - Test: `tests/api-overage-billing.test.mts`
- **Patterns:**
  - `server/_shared/api-key-rate-limit.ts` for pure, injectable, no-Response helpers.
  - `tests/api-key-rate-limit.test.mts` for focused node:test coverage without live Redis or Dodo credentials.
- **Approach:** Export a typed `buildApiOverageUsageEvent` function that returns `null` unless the request is for an eligible paid user API key, the daily meter actually counted, the count is above the included allowance, and the terminal status is a billable code (100–499, excluding 401/403 auth failures and the enforce-mode 429 refusal). The event's `usageDate` is sourced from the meter's own UTC day (not a build-time clock read) so it cannot desync from the count. Include `meterId: "api.request"`, `eventId`, `userId`, `route`, `method`, `status`, `usageDate`, `quantity`, `dailyCount`, `includedAllowance`, and `idempotencyKey`.
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Count at or below allowance returns `null`.
  - Count above allowance returns a single billable unit (`quantity: 1`).
  - 5xx, 401/403, and the enforce-mode 429 return `null`; other 4xx (400/404) are billable.
  - Status outside the 100–499 range returns `null`.
  - Missing user id, unmetered result, or an invalid meter usage day returns `null`.
  - `usageDate` binds to the meter's UTC day, not a build-time clock read (UTC-rollover determinism).
  - Route is canonicalized to the matched path (query string stripped).
  - Idempotency material is stable for the same user, day, route, method, status, and count.
- **Verification:** Run `./node_modules/.bin/tsx --test tests/api-overage-billing.test.mts tests/api-key-rate-limit.test.mts`.

## Verification Contract

| Gate | Command | Done signal |
|---|---|---|
| Focused unit tests | `./node_modules/.bin/tsx --test tests/api-overage-billing.test.mts tests/api-key-rate-limit.test.mts` | New builder tests and existing meter tests pass. |
| API typecheck | `npm run typecheck:api` | Shared server helper compiles under API tsconfig. |

---

## Definition of Done

- U1 is implemented with focused tests and no live Dodo network calls.
- The PR body uses `Related to #4560`, not `Fixes #4560`, because this does not close the epic.
- The diff does not touch secrets, Dodo product pricing, live webhook handlers, or generated Convex artifacts.
